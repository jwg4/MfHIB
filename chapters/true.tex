\chapter{True and False}
\label{true}
\depends{0and1}

\begin{itemize}
\item
We are going to introduce two new mathematical objects, {\sc true} and {\sc false}.
\item
We will also write $T$ for {\sc true} and $F$ for {\sc false}.
\item
{\sc true} is another way of saying $1$ and {\sc false} is another way of saying $0$.
\item
The idea behing {\sc true} and {\sc false} is this -- we have spent many of the preceding chapters arguing that the existence of $0$ and $1$ leads pretty directly to things like $2$ and $3$. We are going to use {\sc true} and {\sc false} in a context where we specifically want to avoid the suggestion that our two symbols lead to a whole host of others. $T + T$ will not be equal to some other thing, nor do we claim that $T$ and $F$ always come in some specific order, or that either of them mean the number of elements of some set.
